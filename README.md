# Racket List Ops
Racket functions for list manipulation: remove element, find indices, sum alternate elements, and square list elements.

This Racket program processes a list of commands and evaluates common list operations such as:

- `remove` – remove all occurrences of an element from a list
- `find-indices` – return all indices of a specific element
- `asum` – compute alternating sum (odd indexed elements subtracted)
- `square` – return the square of each element in the list

---

## Files

- `homework5.rkt` – Main implementation of all list functions.
- `hw5-main.rkt` – Script that reads commands from an input file and applies the corresponding operations.
- `input.txt` – List of function calls to test.
- `output.txt` – Expected output provided by the professor.
- `my-output.txt` – Output generated by our implementation.

---

## How It Works

Each line in `input.txt` represents a function call in this form:

```racket
(remove 2 (6 2 10 7 4 2 3 2 9 6))              ; → (6 10 7 4 3 9 6)
(find-indices 10 (10 7 2 1 1 7 5 10 7 9 4 6))   ; → (0 7)
(asum (12 -14 4 14 14 -11 -19 20 -10))         ; → -8
(square (-4 4 -2 8 3 -6 -16 6 5))              ; → (16 16 4 64 9 36 256 36 25)
```

## Run Instructions
To run the program using Racket:

In terminal or DrRacket:

```bash
Copy code
racket hw5-main.rkt
This will read from input.txt and generate output in my-output.txt.
